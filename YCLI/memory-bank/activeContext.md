# Active Context: y-cli

## Current Focus
Implementing Cloudflare storage integration for chat data, enabling cloud-based persistence and synchronization.

## Recent Changes
1. Added Cloudflare KV and R2 storage support for chat data
2. Implemented repository factory pattern for storage selection
3. Created Cloudflare client for API interactions
4. Added worker script for backup synchronization
5. Updated chat manager to support async repository operations
6. Refactored repository-related files into dedicated repository module

## Active Decisions

### Storage Architecture
- Implemented repository abstraction for storage flexibility
- Created repository factory pattern to select appropriate implementation
- Designed Cloudflare storage with KV for recent changes and R2 for backups
- Added local caching for performance optimization

### Implementation Approach
- Made repository methods async for better performance
- Added logging support with loguru
- Implemented checksum-based synchronization
- Created worker script for automated backups
- Organized repository code in modular structure for better maintainability

## Current Considerations

### Storage Optimization
- Balance between local caching and cloud storage
- Efficient synchronization between KV and R2
- Handling network connectivity issues
- Ensuring data consistency across storage layers

### User Experience
- Transparent storage transitions for users
- Configuration simplicity for Cloudflare setup
- Performance impact of cloud storage
- Backup and recovery workflows

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test Cloudflare storage implementation thoroughly
2. Document configuration process for users
3. Optimize synchronization performance
4. Implement error handling improvements

### Future Tasks
1. Add additional cloud storage providers
2. Enhance backup and recovery features
3. Implement data migration utilities
4. Add storage analytics and monitoring

## Open Questions
1. Performance impact of cloud storage on chat operations
2. Best practices for Cloudflare Worker deployment
3. Error handling strategies for network issues
4. Data migration approach for existing users

## Current Status
Implementing Cloudflare storage integration to provide cloud-based persistence for chat data. Focus on creating a reliable, efficient storage solution with automatic backup capabilities.
